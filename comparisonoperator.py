  # Comparison Operators Practice #1
  # Create two variables (num1 and num2) with the following values: 36 and 17. Check if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool
  num1 = 36
  num2 = 17
  my_bool = num1 >= num2
  print(my_bool)
  
  
  # Comparison Operators Practice #2
  # Create two variables (num1 and num2):
  number1 = math.sqrt(25)
  number2= 5
  # Inside num1, store the result of the square root of 25
  # Inside num2, store the number 5.
  
  # Check if num1 is equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
  mybool2 = number1 == number2 
  print(mybool2)
  # Comparison Operators Practice #3
  # Create two variables (num1 and num2):
  firstnum = 64*3
  secondnum = 24*8
  # Inside num1, store the result of 64 x 3
  
  # Inside num2, store the result of 24 x 8
  
  # Check if num1 is different from num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool
  booltwo = firstnum == secondnum
  print(booltwo)
  print("                  ")
