# Comparison Operators Practice #1
# Create two variables (num1 and num2) with the following values: 36 and 17. Check if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool



# Comparison Operators Practice #2
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):

# Inside num1, store the result of the square root of 25

# Inside num2, store the number 5.

# Check if num1 is equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.

  
# Comparison Operators Practice #3
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):

# Inside num1, store the result of 64 x 3

# Inside num2, store the result of 24 x 8

# Check if num1 is different from num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool

##################### if statements ############################################

# Decision Making Practice #1
# Using the variables num1 and num2, which are fed with user input (just like in the provided code), create a flow control structure that compares the values of the variables, and returns a result according to the case:

# "num1 is greater than num2"

# "num2 is greater than num1"

# "num1 and num2 are equal"

# You must display the value of the user input instead of num1 and num2.
  
# Decision Making Practice #2
# The laws of a certain country establish that an adult can drive if they are of legal age (18 years or older), and have a driver's license.

# Create a conditional structure to check if a 16-year-old without a license can drive, and display the corresponding result on the screen:

# "You can drive"

# "You can't drive yet. You must be 18 years old and have a license"

# "You can't drive. You need to have a license"

# Use the code base already provided to set up the appropriate flow control structure and check those conditions.

# Decision Making Practice #3
# To access a certain job, the candidate must be able to program in Python and speak French.

# Create a conditional structure to evaluate a candidate given these conditions, and display the corresponding message on the screen:

# "You meet the requirements to apply"

# "To apply, you need to know how to program in Python and speak French"

# "To apply, you need to speak French"

# "To apply, you need to know how to program in Python"

# Use the code already provided to set up the appropriate flow control structure and check those conditions. Evaluate a candidate who knows French, but does not know how to program in Python.

##################loops and for loops###################################
# For Loops Practice #1
# Using For loops, greet all members of a class, printing "Hello" + their name.

# For example: "Hello Norville"

# students = ["Norville", "Fred", "Velma", "Daphne"]


# For Loops Practice #2
# Given the following list of numbers, calculate the sum of all the numbers using For loops and store the result of the sum in a variable called sum_numbers:

# list_numbers = [1,5,8,7,6,8,2,5,2,6,4,8,5,9,8,3,5,4,2,5,6,4]

# For Loops Practice #3
# Given the following list of numbers, perform the sum of all even and odd* numbers separately in the variables sum_even and sum_odd respectively:

# list_numbers = [1,5,8,7,6,8,2,5,2,6,4,8,5,9,8,3,5,4,2,5,6,4]

# *Recall from previous days: the modulus (or remainder) of a number divided by 2 is zero when said value is even, and 1 when it is odd

# num % 2 == 0 (even values)

# num % 2 == 1 (odd values)

################## end loops and for loops###################################

############################while loops#####################################
# While Loops Practice #1
# Create a While Loop that prints the numbers 10 to 0 on the screen, one at a time.


# While Loops Practice #2
# Create a While Loop that subtracts one by one the numbers from 50 to 0 (both numbers included) with the following additional conditions:

# If the number is divisible by 5, show that number on the screen (remember that here you can use the modulus operation dividing by 5 and checking the remainder!)

# If the number is not divisible by 5, continue executing the loop without showing the value on the screen (don't forget to continue subtracting so that the program doesn't run infinitely).


# Loop Interruption Statements Practice
# Create a For loop through the following list of numbers, printing each of its elements to the screen, and interrupt the flow when you find a negative value:

# list_numbers = [4,5,8,7,6,9,8,2,4,5,7,1,9,5,6,-1,-5,6,-6,-4,-3]

# You must not change the order of the list.

###################range practice############################################
# Range Practice #1
# Create a list consisting of all the numbers from 2500 to 2585 (inclusive). Store this list in the variable my_list.

# Range Practice #2
# Using the range() function, create in a single line of code a list consisting of all numbers that are multiples of 3 from 3 to 300 (inclusive). Store this list in the variable my_list.

# Range Practice #3
# Use the range() function and a loop to add the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 15 (inclusive). Store the result in a variable called sum_squares.



# For this purpose:

# Create a range of values that you can iterate through in a loop

# For each of these values, find its squared value (power of 2). You may need to create intermediate variables (optionally).

# Sum all the squared values obtained. Accumulate the sum in the variable sum_squares.

###################enumerator in python########################################

# Enumerator Practice #1
# Print sentences like the following on the screen:

# '{name} is found at index {index}'

# Where name must be each of the names in the list below, and the index, must be obtained via enumerate().

# list_names = ["Steven", "Jackie", "Donna", "Kelso", "Eric", "Fez", "Kitty", "Red"]

# You can use the given print() line as an example and change its variable names, but the returned phrases must be the same!

# Tip: use loops!

# Enumerator Practice #2
# Create a list formed by the tuples (index, element), obtained through enumerating the indices of each character of the "Python" string.

# Call the returned list with the variable name indices_list.


# Enumerator Practice #3
# Print to the screen only the indices of those names in the list below, that start with M:

# list_names = ["Maverick", "Alice", "Madeline", "Hazel", "Jack", "Meadow", "Thomas", "Emily", "Mills"]

# You can solve it in different ways, but it will help you keeping mind some (if not all) the following elements:

# loops

# if conditionals

# the enumerate() method

# string methods and indexing

##########################zip in python#####################################
# Zip Practice #1
# Print to the screen phrases like the following example:

# "The capital of Germany is Berlin"

# Use the zip function, loops, and the following lists of countries and capitals to solve it quickly and efficiently.

# capitals = ["Berlin", "Tokyo", "Paris", "Helsinki", "Ottawa", "Canberra"]
# countries = ["Germany", "Japan", "France", "Finland", "Canada", "Australia"]


# Zip Practice #2
# Create a zip object made up of lists, of a set of brands and products that you prefer, inside the my_zip variable.

# Zip Practice #3
# Create a zip object with the translations of the numbers from 1 to 5 in Spanish, Portuguese and English (in that same order), and then convert the generated object into a list called numbers:

# uno / um / one

# dos / dois / two

# tres / trÃªs / three

# cuatro / quatro / four

# cinco / cinco / five

# The result should follow the structure:

# [('one', 'um', 'one'), ('two', 'dois', 'two'), ...
