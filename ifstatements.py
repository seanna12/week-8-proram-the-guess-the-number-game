    # Decision Making Practice #1
    # Using the variables num1 and num2, which are fed with user input (just like in the provided code), create a flow control structure that compares the values of the variables, and returns a result according to the case:
  
    # "num1 is greater than num2"
  
    # "num2 is greater than num1"
  
    # "num1 and num2 are equal"
  
    # You must display the value of the user input instead of num1 and num2.
  
    # Decision Making Practice #2
    # The laws of a certain country establish that an adult can drive if they are of legal age (18 years or older), and have a driver's license.
  
    # Create a conditional structure to check if a 16-year-old without a license can drive, and display the corresponding result on the screen:
  
    # "You can drive"
  
    # "You can't drive yet. You must be 18 years old and have a license"
  
    # "You can't drive. You need to have a license"
  
    # Use the code base already provided to set up the appropriate flow control structure and check those conditions.
  
    # Decision Making Practice #3
    # To access a certain job, the candidate must be able to program in Python and speak French.
  
    # Create a conditional structure to evaluate a candidate given these conditions, and display the corresponding message on the screen:
  
    # "You meet the requirements to apply"
  
    # "To apply, you need to know how to program in Python and speak French"
  
    # "To apply, you need to speak French"
  
    # "To apply, you need to know how to program in Python"
  
    # Use the code already provided to set up the appropriate flow control structure and check those conditions. Evaluate a candidate who knows French, but does not know how to program in Python.
