    # While Loops Practice #1
    # Create a While Loop that prints the numbers 10 to 0 on the screen, one at a time.
  
  
    # While Loops Practice #2
    # Create a While Loop that subtracts one by one the numbers from 50 to 0 (both numbers included) with the following additional conditions:
  
    # If the number is divisible by 5, show that number on the screen (remember that here you can use the modulus operation dividing by 5 and checking the remainder!)
  
    # If the number is not divisible by 5, continue executing the loop without showing the value on the screen (don't forget to continue subtracting so that the program doesn't run infinitely).
  
  
    # Loop Interruption Statements Practice
    # Create a For loop through the following list of numbers, printing each of its elements to the screen, and interrupt the flow when you find a negative value:
  
    # list_numbers = [4,5,8,7,6,9,8,2,4,5,7,1,9,5,6,-1,-5,6,-6,-4,-3]
  
    # You must not change the order of the list.
